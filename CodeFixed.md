Certainly! Here's a list of the bugs in the provided code, along with the fixes for each bug. You can use this information to create a second markdown file explaining how to fix these issues.

### Bugs in the Code:

1. **Missing Imports**: In both `Dogs.jsx` and `Dog.jsx`, the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used without importing them from `react`. The code will throw errors related to these hooks.

2. **Missing State Declaration**: In `Dogs.jsx`, the `useState` hook is used to manage the `dogBreed` state, but it's missing the `useState` declaration.

3. **Incorrect Prop Passing**: In `Dogs.jsx`, the `Dog` component is used with `dog={dog}`. However, `dog` should be spread into the component using `{...dog}` instead.

4. **Missing Dependency in useEffect**: In `Dogs.jsx`, the `useEffect` hook is missing the dependency array. It should include `[dogBreed]` to ensure the effect is triggered when `dogBreed` changes.

5. **Missing Key in Dog Component**: In `Dogs.jsx`, when mapping over `dogData` to render `Dog` components, the `key` prop is missing.

6. **Using Image Alt Incorrectly**: In `Dog.jsx`, when using the ternary operator to decide which image to display, `alt` should be set to a meaningful value like `dog?.name` instead of `"image"`.

7. **Incorrect ClassName**: In `Dog.jsx`, the class name should be `details` instead of `className="details"`.

### Fixes for the Bugs:

#### 1. Import React Hooks:

In both `Dogs.jsx` and `Dog.jsx`, add the necessary import statements for the React hooks at the top of the files:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
```

#### 2. Declare State for dogBreed:

In `Dogs.jsx`, declare the state for `dogBreed` using the `useState` hook:

```jsx
const [dogBreed, setDogBreed] = useState("");
```

#### 3. Correct Prop Passing:

In `Dogs.jsx`, change the prop passing for the `Dog` component to spread the `dog` object:

```jsx
{dogData.map((dog) => (
  <Dog key={dog.id} {...dog} />
))}
```

#### 4. Add Dependency Array in useEffect:

In `Dogs.jsx`, add `[dogBreed]` as the dependency array in the `useEffect` hook:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  handleSearch();
}, [dogBreed]);
```

#### 5. Add Key to Dog Component:

In `Dogs.jsx`, add the `key` prop when mapping over `dogData`:

```jsx
{dogData.map((dog) => (
  <Dog key={dog.id} {...dog} />
))}
```

#### 6. Correct Image Alt Usage:

In `Dog.jsx`, set the `alt` attribute to `dog?.name`:

```jsx
<img
  src={`https://cdn2.thedogapi.com/images/${dog?.reference_image_id}_1280.jpg`}
  className="poster"
  alt={dog?.name}
/>
```

#### 7. Correct ClassName:

In `Dog.jsx`, use the class name directly without `className`:

```jsx
<p class="details">Temperament: {dog?.temperament}</p>
<p class="details">Origin: {dog?.origin}</p>
```
